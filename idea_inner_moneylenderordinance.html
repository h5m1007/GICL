                    <p>
                        FORM OF SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE TO BE INCLUDED IN OR ATTACHED TO A NOTE OR MEMORANDUM OF A LOAN AGREEMENT.The provisions of the Money Lenders Ordinance summarized below are important for the protection of all the parties to a loan agreement, and should be read carefully. The summary is not part of the law, and reference should be made to the provisions of the Ordinance itself in case of doubt.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="padding-top:25px;"><strong>Summary of Part IV of the Ordinance-Excessive interest rates</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        ection 24 fixes the maximum effective rate of interest on any loan at 60% per annum (the “effective rate” is to be calculated in accordance with the Second Schedule to the Ordinance). A loan agreement providing for a higher effective rate will be unenforceable and the lender will be liable to prosecution. This maximum rate may be changed by the Legislative Council but not so as to affect existing agreements. The section does not apply to any loan made to a company which has a paid up share capital of not less than $1000000 or, in respect of any such loan, to any person who makes that loan.

                    <h4><strong>Summary of Part III of the Ordinance-Money lenders transactions</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 18 sets out the requirements relating to loans made by a money lender. Every agreement for a loan must be put into writing and signed by the borrower within 7 days of making the agreement and before the money is lent. A copy of the signed note of the agreement must be given to the borrower, with a copy of this summary, at the time of signing. The signed note must contain full details of the loan, including the terms of repayment, the form of security and the rate of interest. An agreement which does not comply with the requirements will be unenforceable, except where a court is satisfied that it would be unjust not to enforce it.
                        <br>
                        <br> Section 19 provides that a money lender must, if requested in writing and on payment of the prescribed fee for expenses, give the original and a copy of a written statement of a borrower’s current position under a loan agreement, including how much has been paid, how much is due or will be due, and the rate of interest. The borrower must endorse on the copy of the statement words to the effect that he has received the original of the written statement and return the copy as so endorsed to the money lender. The money lender must retain the copy of the statement so returned.
